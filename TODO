* Look into ROOT_URLCONF settings variable for Django?
    This setting should be to change the web root of the Django application.
* README.md: Grab the size on disk (according to dpkg and Docker)
* README.md: Grab memory requirements from systemd
* postrm script to remove Docker volumes
* Devise a way to enable/disable whole locations/services at runtime?
* Re-map user id of files within containers
    https://docs.docker.com/engine/security/userns-remap/
* Set up non-root user with systemd.
* docker-compose.yml: Django project as packaged pip application
* docker-compose.yml: persist container logs to volume
    certbot:/var/log/letsencrypt.log
    nginx:/var/log/nginx/{access,error}.log
* Verify all containers have the same timezone.
* Cron to get regular backups of the images
* Cron to archive all backup images regularly and keep a few around
* Add command to edtwardy-webservices.bash instructing docker-volume-manager to
  backup downstream volumes. This command should mount a special backup
  location to prevent overwriting the running volumes
* Document format/behavior of volumes.dvm.lock in README.md
* Integrate tar --diff option
    This option compares the contents of the volume to the contents on disk.
    Useful to prevent unnecessarily changing the contents of disk.
* Currently, data volumes backup archives are required to exist in VOLPATH,
    even if we aren't initializing or backing them up. This is probably not the
    best behavior.
* This repository doesn't really support testing "in-repository." It should.
* Implement MAC using Nginx to remove auth/auth, identity mgmt. from apps.
* apps: Store the SECRET_KEY in a Bash script, source the script at runtime.
* We should be building the Debian package in Docker or a fakeroot to ensure
  all dependencies are captured in the debian/control file. For example, we
  probably rely on a Python package or two from PyPI, which can't be installed
  via apt/dpkg.
* This repository should provide an apt list once mini-dinstall is added.
* We should be careful to remove apt/dpkg/apk from OCI images, or whatever
  programs are unnecessary.
* Currently, if any of the images assembled during the build process are
  removed, but the build.lock file remains on the filesystem, the build system
  will not attempt to rebuild the images.
* We should create a git-hook that ensures images assembled during the build
  are pushed up to docker hub and tagged appropriately.
* Freeze ALL dependencies and dependencies of dependencies for Python apps.
* Look into ways to make the Python applications faster. See the following
  link: https://packaging.python.org/overview/
* Some variables, like the port in the edtwardy/apps image, are speciied as
  magic numbers in too many places.
* The image could probably benefit from a layer containing the uwsgi wheels.
* Create non-root user for uWSGI application
* Connect Nginx and uWSGI using a Unix socket.
* Do not build Docker containers when building make package target.
